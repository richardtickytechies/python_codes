# This is how to get a return from python.
# The return needs to have an indentation, or it would not work.
# What this code basically does is that it cubes a number (a.k.a. ^3) that you put into the parameter.
def cube(number):
    return pow(number,3)
result1=cube(5)
print(result1)
# You could also store the results in a variable.
# Note that printing text after the return statement wouldn't work, because it breaks out of the function.
