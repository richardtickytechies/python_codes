# Tuples are containers that can store several values.
# Tuples are similar to a list.
coords=(4,5)
# Tuples are immutable
# It means that it can't be changed or modified.
print(coords[1])
#This is how to print a specific item in a tuples
#Remember they are accessed by index starting from 0
coordslist=[4,123,"hello"]
coordslist[0]=10
print(coordslist)
# This is a list. The only difference between tuples and lists is that you cannot change the items in tuples,
# While in lists, you can change the list.
coords=[(4,5),(345,5),(4,23)]
print(coords)
# This is how to print a list of Tuples.
# Tuples are normally used to store data that is never going to change, for instance, coordinates.
